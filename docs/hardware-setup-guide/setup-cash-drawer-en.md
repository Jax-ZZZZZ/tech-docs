**Step 1:**  
Please note that the **cash drawer is controlled by the receipt printer**.  
The cash drawer cable must be connected to the **receipt printer**, not directly to the POS terminal.

**Step 2:**  
Cash drawer cables are typically **RJ11 / RJ12**.  
Beyond Menu uses a **6-pin cash drawer cable**.

**Step 3:**  
After the hardware connection is completed, please contact  
**Beyond Menu Technical Support** to configure and test the cash drawer in the POS system.
