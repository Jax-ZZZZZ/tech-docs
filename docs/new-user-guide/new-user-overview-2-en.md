#### Payment Method Security & Risk Disclosure

To ensure transaction security and reduce the risk of chargebacks,  
we recommend using the following payment methods in order of security (from highest to lowest):

1. **Tap / Contactless / Apple Pay**
2. **Chip (EMV)**
3. **Swipe (Magnetic Stripe)**
4. **Manual Entry**

Notes:
- Tap and Chip offer the same level of security, and their processing fees are usually similar
- For Tap / Chip transactions:
  - Customers are generally unable to file certain types of chargebacks under “fraud”
  - Other types of chargebacks may still occur
- **Compared to Manual Entry, more secure payment methods such as Tap and Chip  
  typically have slightly lower merchant service fees**
- Different chargeback types require different supporting documentation

#### Manual Entry Risk Notice

Manual Entry transactions usually require only:
- Card number
- Expiration date

Because of the higher risk, the system enforces the following security measure by default:
- **CVV is required**

⚠️ Even when these requirements are met, banks generally prioritize cardholder protection during chargeback reviews.  
To have a chance of winning a chargeback, **all** of the following must be satisfied:

- Customer signature
- CVV match
- ZIP code match
- Billing address number match

✅ **Strongly Recommended:**
- For high-value transactions
- Especially when using Manual Entry  
always request the physical credit card, and verify a photo ID when possible.
