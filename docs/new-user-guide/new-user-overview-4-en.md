#### Debit Card Pre-Authorization Notice

When a **debit card with a low available balance (typically under $1,000)** is used,  
restaurant transactions may trigger a **pre-authorization hold** from the bank:

- The bank may temporarily hold an amount **approximately 20% higher than the original transaction**
- This additional amount is intended to cover potential tips
- The hold helps prevent the final settlement amount from exceeding the available balance

---

#### Example

- POS transaction amount: $100  
- Amount shown by the customer’s bank app or text alert: $120  

🔔 This is a **normal pre-authorization display** and **not an extra charge**.

Once the restaurant completes the **daily batch settlement**,  
the bank will automatically adjust the charge to the correct final amount.
